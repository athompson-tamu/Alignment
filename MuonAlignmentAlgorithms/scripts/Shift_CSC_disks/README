1) In the validation browser, observe if in the first iteration is present a sinuosoidal behaviour

2) If so you can extract the fit parameters to print out the shifts in a txt file
python PrintShiftsToTxt.py

3) Then you can use that txt to correct the geometry and proced an initial geoemtry without any shift
python PrintShiftedXML_fromTXT.py

4) Rerun the alignment with this geoemtry in order to check in the validation browser if in the first iteration has no sinuosoidal behaviour
