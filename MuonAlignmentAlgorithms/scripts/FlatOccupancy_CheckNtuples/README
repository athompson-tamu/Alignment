1) Flattening the Occupancy
  a) Run 1 iteration of Alignment (this will create a root file for DEBUG called "your_folder/your_folder.root")
  b) Run the script that produce a .txt that you need to copy paste inside:
                Alignment/MuonAlignmentAlgorithms/interface/OccupancyFlat.h
     -> pyhton MakeOccupancyFlat_pt1.py your_folder/your_folder.root -b
     -> pyhton MakeOccupancyFlat_pt2.py Output_Occupancy Output.root -b
  c) You will aply thos weight once you build you likelihhod in:
                Alignment/MuonAlignmentAlgorithms/src/MuonResiduals5DOFFitter.cc (MuonResiduals5DOFFitter_FCN)
                Alignment/MuonAlignmentAlgorithms/src/MuonResiduals6DOFFitter.cc (MuonResiduals6DOFFitter_FCN)

2) Produce DEBUG plots frpom the DEBUG Ntuples
  a) Run 1 iteration or more of Alignment (this will create a root file for DEBUG called "your_folder/your_folder.root" for each iteration)
  b) Run the script that from the TTree will produce TH1 and TH2
     -> python DT_DEBUG_plots_pt1.py your_folder/your_folder.root -b
  c) Make some fits to histograms and other study before to save final PDF
     -> python DT_DEBUG_plots_pt2.py OutputFolder Output.root -b
  d) Enjoy your plots.
