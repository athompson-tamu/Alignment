Here a lost of the macors in some folders:

signConventions.py         : store the needed change of the sign in the local coordinates (used in PlottingTools and when comparing 2 geometries)
geometryXMLparser.py       : takes a xml geometry file and allow to create a class that contains the geometry
alignCSCRings.py           : allign the CSC disks as a whole body (ShiftCSCGeometry_Fn.py PrintShiftsToTxt.py PrintShiftedXML_fromTXT.py)
LUMI                       : it studies how the uncertainty depends on the nuber of muon/chamber
FlatOccupancy_CheckNtuples : it studies the alignment where residuals are flats vx X and Y
EventFlow.sh               : prints the total number of muon after each cut
Hacking_XML                : allow to create a xml geoemtry with a given smearing
COMPUTE_APE                : compute and display the APEs from covariance matrix or from histograms
MINUIT_TESTmacro           : a single macro to make some tests on how MINUIT works
FIXING_sigmas              : take the post-fit sigma of the residual and print it in a txt file (hacking a bit the code it is possible to use post-fit value instead that fitting also the residuals sigmas, but we saw that it make almost no difference)
