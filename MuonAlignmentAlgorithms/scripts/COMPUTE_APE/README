# Computing APEs

1) CREATE_APEs.py
  -> From the _report.py file we extract the covariance matrix and we compute the APEs. In simulation we also can take the ideal geoemtry and the final one and we can extract the APEs from the correlation among the coordinates
  -> The

2) TEST_APEs.py
  -> We test the coverage of the APEs that should return a chi2 distribution for 6 dof. In the case of the APEs extracted from the correlation plots, this should be true by default.

3) Display_APE.py
  -> The APEs, and the correlation among the coordinates can be placed into a single plots. Also 2 different APEs can be compared.

4) ConvertXMLtoSQLite_cfg.py
  -> Convert APE from xml to db (so we can use them)
